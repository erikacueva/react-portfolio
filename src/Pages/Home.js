            Thanks for checking out my portfolio! As you can tell, I am new to
            web development, but I am eager to learn as much as I can while
            enrolled in the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.
            <p>
              I graduated from SDSU with a degree in journalism. I have been
              working as a paralegal for the past eight years. I have been
              anxious for a career switch for several years. I am glad I finally
              took a leap of faith and enrolled in this program.
            </p>
            Lately, my life has revolved around coding. When I had free time, I
            would spend it in the woodshop - another skill I picked up in the
            past few years. On long weekends I like to go camping. And if I
            receive a Google alert for a cheap flight to a city on my must-see
            list, I don't hesitate to book the ticket.
            <p>
              I would love to connect with other web developers! Find me on{" "}
